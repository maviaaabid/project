# Search Box Hover and Zoom Effects Removal

## Problem Addressed
User requested to remove the hover and zoom effects that occur on game boxes during search operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Changes (`public/js/search.js`)

**Removed Zoom Effects from Search Results:**
- In `showOnlyBox()` function: Changed `transform: 'scale(1.05)'` to `transform: ''`
- In autocomplete selection: Changed `transform: 'scale(1.05)'` and `transform: 'scale(1)'` to `transform: ''`  
- In `filterBoxes()` function: Changed `transform: 'scale(1)'` to `transform: ''`
- Updated `centerSearchResults()` function to remove zoom effects while keeping visual highlighting

**Before:**
```javascript
box.style.transform = 'scale(1.05)'; // Zoom effect for exact matches
box.style.transform = 'scale(1)';    // Zoom effect for partial matches
```

**After:**
```javascript
box.style.transform = ''; // No zoom effects - preserves responsive sizing
```

### 2. CSS Changes (`public/css/style.css`)

**Disabled Hover Effects on Box Content Overlays:**
- Added global CSS rule to disable all box content hover interactions
- Commented out all individual `.box .content:hover` rules
- Added `pointer-events: none` to prevent hover triggers
- Forced `opacity: 0` on hover states to ensure overlay stays hidden

**Added CSS Rules:**
```css
/* Global rule to disable all box content hover effects */
.box .content,
.box-1 .content-1, .box-2 .content-2, /* ... all boxes ... */ {
    pointer-events: none !important;
}

/* Disable hover pseudo-selectors on box content */
.box .content:hover,
.box-1 .content-1:hover, /* ... all boxes ... */ {
    opacity: 0 !important;
    transform: none !important;
    border: none !important;
}
```

## Effects Removed

- ❌ Boxes no longer zoom in (`scale(1.05)`) when found as exact matches

- ✅ Boxes maintain their responsive sizes during search operations

### 2. **Hover Content Overlays**
- ❌ Dark overlay content no longer appears on box hover
